      Anuv is definitely not funny
      <!---Division in script will always convert answers to decimals unless told otherwise, I guess --->
      <script type="text/javascript">
      //alert(x*(y+z)); SO basically, the alert will alert you of stuff. that's pretty self-explanantory lol. Whatever is in the parenthesis is what the alert will alert you of
      function egg(a, b) {
        var anuv = a+b;
        //Notes are really easy to do now lol
        return anuv;
      }
      var name = egg(1234, 6789);
      //alert(name);
      var mystring = "Mom's ";
      var str = "Spaghetti";
      var combined = mystring + str;
      alert(combined);
      //alert(mystring); This alert shows words rather than numbers
